# ALX Online Shopping

This is the final project for the Alx foundation stage, completed by Mikias Hailu and Yared Tsgie.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- JavaScript
- Django
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS
- SQLite3 database

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Change directory to the "ALX-Onlineshopping" folder and enter the "Alxshop" directory where the `manage.py` file is located.
3. Ensure Python 3, pip, and virtualenv are installed on your machine.
4. Create a virtual environment:
   - For Mac and Linux: `python3 -m venv venv`
   - For Windows: `python -m venv venv`
5. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Mac and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - For Windows: `venv\scripts\activate`
6. Install application requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Migrate the database: `python manage.py migrate`
8. Start the server: `python manage.py runserver`
9. Access the application at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

Now, your README.md file is formatted with Markdown, making it visually organized and readable. When you preview it on platforms like GitHub, it should appear as expected.
